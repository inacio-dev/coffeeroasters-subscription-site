## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local environment:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/inacio-dev/coffeeroasters-subscription-site.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd coffeeroasters-subscription-site
   ```

3. Install dependencies using one of the following package managers (choose one):

   ```bash
   npm install
   yarn install
   pnpm install
   ```

4. After installing dependencies, start the project:

   ```bash
   npm start
   yarn start
   pnpm start
   ```

The site will be available at [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321/).

## Project Structure

Inside your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

   ```bash
      /
      ├── public/
      ├── src/
      │ ├── assets/
      │ ├── components/
      │ ├── layouts/
      │ └── pages/
      └── package.json
   ```
Astro looks for .astro or .md files in the src/pages/ directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about src/components/, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public/ directory.

## Using Astro

This project was built using the Astro framework. If you're new to Astro and want to learn more about how to use it, follow these steps:

1. Install Astro globally (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
      npm install -g astro
   ```

2. Create a new Astro project using the basics template:

   ```bash
      npm create astro@latest -- --template basics
   ```

3. Start your Astro project locally:

   ```bash
      npm run dev
   ```

Your Astro project will be available at http://localhost:3000.

4. To build your production site, run:

   ```bash
      npm run build
   ```

5. For more information and advanced usage of Astro, refer to the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/).
