    <p class="mt-6 mb-10 lg:mb-14">
      We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to make
      it easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the
      source. To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year
      trying to understand the challenges and opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate
      with exceptional coffee growers and empower a global community of farmers through with well
      above fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training, support farm community initiatives, and
      invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast each lot to
      highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing region.
